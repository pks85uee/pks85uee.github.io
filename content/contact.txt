CONTACT INFORMATION

Email: puneet.singh@iiml.org
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/yourprofile
Twitter / X: @yourhandle


CONTACT FORM SETUP (OPTIONAL)
------------------------------

The contact form on the website is currently a UI placeholder. To make it functional, 
you have these FREE options:

OPTION 1: Use Formspree (Recommended for beginners)
- Go to formspree.io
- Sign up with your email
- Create a new form
- Copy your form ID (looks like: abc123def456)
- In contact.html, replace "YOUR_FORM_ID" in this line:
  action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"
- Save and test!

OPTION 2: Use Netlify Forms (Best if hosting on Netlify)
- Just add this to the <form> tag:
  netlify
- That's it! Netlify will handle form submissions automatically

OPTION 3: Use EmailJS (No backend needed)
- Go to emailjs.com
- Sign up and follow their setup
- Add their JavaScript to contact.html
- Configure your email details


HOW TO EDIT:
- Replace "hello@example.com" with your actual email
- Replace "linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" with your LinkedIn profile URL
- Replace "@yourhandle" with your Twitter/X handle
- Follow the instructions above to enable form submissions
- If you don't want a contact form, you can leave it as is (just links)
